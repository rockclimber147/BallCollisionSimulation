When I switch out the uniform grid subhandlers and then teardown and re create the grid, there is a lot of duplicate UI stuff.

THe duplicate fragments work with the simulation but ui updates don't

When I switch the dropdown and then  switch from UG to other to UG, the UG subH dropdown reverts to naive, issue with data persistence and recreating it causing duplicates?

Some times I get an error in the console that the component container does not exist to teardown (calling replaceChildren on it)

Looks like the amount of stuff that is duplicated is multiplied by 3 each time (the amount of children in the dropdown)

Issue seems to be isolated to switching out the UG to other things from simulation



Look into handler switch component
